Interview:

api -> service

We need to send the data to one api(service) to another service

1. HttpClient - pure c# (.net)
2. Azure Service Bus
	1. Queue 
		- One consumer per message
		- FIFO - first in first out
	2. Topic Subscriber 
		- multiple subscriber receive message
		- independent per subsciber

Single Producer and single receiver - we need to user service bus queue
Multiple receiver - we need to use service bus topic

Queue
Whatsapp - one to one chat

Topic
Whatsapp group - multiple user multiple subscriber
